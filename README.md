# Vegnerd

Vegnerd is a Web app with the target of making some bookkeeping within gardening less painfull. You can add and modify layouts and place garden plants there as well as information about their care in the app. Especially in the initial growing phase it may be difficult to distinguish different plants from each other and it is this area that the app targets. 

The most current version of the main branch of the codebase resides at [https://vegnerd.azurewebsites.net/|https://vegnerd.azurewebsites.net/] and is available for testing there. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
